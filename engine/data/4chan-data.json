    "title": "Can a lawyer be charged with fraud for: >before I signed a Workers Comp contract, I noticed Medicare was saying they wouldn't cover the injuries that were suffered from a work place accident if another insurance company was liable for it; which this was the lawsuit to sue them for the injuries. The lawyer told me earlier that Medicare would cover it when I found out; by deduction, that the amount being offered for the surgery wasn't very much. But they followed up that with saying it's in the judges hands now because we were going to the hearing. But the judge still had 30 days. >we came to an agreement before the 30 days. I wasn't thinking about the back surgery because they (the lawyer) never really talked with me about it but said it was being covered and only by my doing the math did I figure out it wasn't very much... And neither did we go over what the cost of the surgery would be. But i assumed they were taking care of all of that. I got the contract, and read through it. Noticed it says right on it, Medicare won't cover the surgery. Called her and told her (the lawyer) about it.  ..They told me they would get the judge to put somewhere, that the back injuries weren't associated with the wreck. Then that way, Medicare \"would\" cover it.  Didn't sound right to me, the only decisions the judge was supposed to make was also in telling them how much they were going to pay I told them this was unacceptable. They quit. Found out later they never even put the injuries on the original claim. They were right in the doctors records they put on the court record.  Is what the lawyer asked, even possible, dont know they never talked about it over with me, and it sounds like the insurance company would say, they werent on the original claim and they werent sued for so anything else opinions about are not acceptable. And is what they saying, not only impossible, bullshit but also fraud?",

The holocaust became the foundation creation myth for modern morals. Neo-atheists simply comply with the authority of some scientists that tells them what to believe as true and they accept it under blind faith. Much like religious people who never read or understand scripture, in the same way these people cannot read scientific papers or do basic algebra. The big bang is literally an \"out of nothing\" scripture with the only explanation being mathematical abstracts that scientists themselves do not even understand. Same question remains. Who or what make it bang? Go further down and you have to ask \"who created the creator?\". If you say \"all everything existed and just recycles itself\" then you starting to get somewhere. Anything else and you a digging yourself into a deeper derp hole.  What makes someone intelligent is non belief in anything. Questioning everything from the holocaust to manned moon landings and so on. Assume the null hypothesis, in everything from Elon, the system and how things work. This is what makes the wheels in your brain spin. Most people, including atheists cannot do this. They would rather let someone else do the thinking for them. Most people, atheists or not need someone else to tell them what to believe. They don't have an independent authority. They actually hate having one.  Free yourself from belief.

    "title": "Forbidden Knowledge Thread - 500 Years of Forbidden History: This story begins in the mid-1500s when Jews, expelled from Spain and Portugal during the inquisitions of the late 1400s, found refuge and eventually established a significant presence in Amsterdam. Over time, they played a key role in shaping the city's financial landscape, including the creation of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in 1602 and the establishment of the Bank of Amsterdam in 1609. These institutions became models for future financial systems. Many people overlook the fact that the United States made early attempts to form a central bank, first in 1791 and again in 1816. The first central bank, established in 1791, operated for 20 years before Congress refused to renew its charter. This decision contributed to the economic instability that ultimately led to the War of 1812. In Europe, the financial center of gravity shifted from Amsterdam to London following the Glorious Revolution of 1688. The Bank of England, established in 1694, became a cornerstone of this new financial order. Jewish banking dynasties, who had already tested their financial systems in Amsterdam, played a significant role in this transition. The Glorious Revolution also marked the end of the centuries-long struggle in England over absolutism and the divine right of kings, as power shifted to Parliament. The City of London, a sovereign entity within England, emerged as the new hub of global finance, heavily influenced by these banking interests.",

The reason behind is the forced secularization of institutions, the demonization of nationalism and the occupation of academia by Jews jews have a ethnic monopoly of the intelligence class, and use that power to both confront races and to keep them secular, meaning, not perceptive of jews Jews need to be intangible and unperceived to mantain a monopoly over academia and institutions If they mantain a Monopoly over academia they can as well do so over media, if they have a monopoly over media and academia they are those who staff financial institutions and promote logistics and similar business that require publicity. If they have a monopoly over this they have a total grip over the operational system of society, which can be only mantained if they are invisible before you, as it is understood that a system is better obfuscated to mantain centralization of power, as it is better to prevent attacks against it (mental information, meaning, logistics and economics, consultancy and politics are the backbone of society) and what way is better than supressing their enemies racial consciousness? If you dont see the jew you cant see the issue. because you dont understand the system To understand the current situation of western lesders you must see where the money comes from Is from ngos, business, financial pressure, investment. And all of that comes from american market invasion led by the people that heads academia. And guess who that people is?",

    "title": "Humans deserve execution for being conceived -- Christianity: Christianity is a bizarre religion. I will not say it is sick or twisted, as I am not prepared to go that far, but it is definitely morbid, worshiping images of a man nailed to a cross and saying every conceived embryo deserves to be killed for the original sin of Adam and Eve. That's why we die, according to Christianity: because Adam and Eve ate a forbidden apple, so God cursed all humanity to suffer and rot and die. I can definitely see the argument that pre-Christian paganism was more life affirming and that Christianity, like Buddhism, is sort of a death cult. The whole point of life is just to wait to die so we can go to the better place, which is the next life and the next world.  Evangelicals try to flip all this upside down but what they're doing is heresy that defies 2000 years of established Christian tradition and theology. Evangelicals try to make Christianity worldly like Judaism and Islam, but they are out of their element, since Christianity, in its bones, is morbid and death-oriented.  So in the ethnostate, or the Fourth Reich, will Christianity be replaced by neo-paganism, Islam, or a new religion altogether. Hitler said Europe would have developed better and more aggressively had it become Islamic. Maybe the future Islamic Europe, intermixed with a lot of Aryan genetics, will be much more powerful than Christian Europe ever was, and will rule the world for 1000 years as Hitler intended for the Third Reich. To you Muslims now in Europe, would you be European nationalists if Europe became Islamic and formed an Islamic, expansionistic Fourth Reich?",

They are fed grain, instead of the wide variety of herbs that grow in pastures, which is their natural diet. Some cages are so small, that the animal can't even turn around. The cages are not cleaned properly, so the animals are living in their own feces. They then are given antibiotics to counter the diseases. Antibiotics are not allowed for Organic livestock. If an Organic livestock animal does get sick, it is given an antibiotic and sold to an non-Organic farm. But disallowing them from being given antibiotics means they have to have higher living standards. Non-Organic livestock animals can also be given steroids. Not allowed for Organic. And Non-Organic livestock can be fed non-Organic feed, feed made with synthetic pesticides and preservatives. What a wonder it is that this is not mentioned in the list of reforms. The reforms he's calling for are great, don't get me wrong. But the resounding silence on livestock morality is telling. Of what? Of the strangehold that Big Food has in the political process. GMOs is also a problem, and is not mentioned. Large companies edit a crop's genes to be more bacteria-resistant. If a small farm accidentally acquires this crop through cross-pollination, the company that made the GMO can sue them. All livestock should be required to spend at least half their days outdoors. Some labels that say \"Pasture-raised\" are allowed to say that if the animals are \"given access\" to going outside, like if they leave the door open, whether or not the animals actually go outside. Animals should not be slaughtered until they die of old age. Yes, the meat will be tough, but d-a-r-n it, simmer it in a stew or something.

She got some work done on her lips (injections), but they actually look really great and suit her face. Problem is, she won't give me the time of day. I accidentally liked one of her facebook pictures from 4 years ago, and when I saw her at work I approached her and said I don't know what happened, my friend was doing some weird stuff on my facebook, plus my app has been on the fritz. She didn't say anything or really react at all and just went back to doing her work, so I guess she forgot. And she has blue eyes and once I said her eyes look like blueberries and said I was hungry and would like to eat one. Again she didn't really react and just directed her attention to her work so I guess it was fine. What do you think I should do bros? I feel like I need to really impress her and show her how much I've self improved the last five years. Should I mention her Jewishness? I think it might go a long way towards breaking the ice and building a good rapport, but I'm not sure. What would you guys do?",

From meeting Nancy for the first time, she made us feel at ease and was clearly very organised and prepared. Our daughter took to her very quickly and would become visibly excited every time she greeted her in the mornings. When we came to pick our daughter up, she was the happiest girl. We regilarly got updates throughout the day, and Nancy went out of her way to ensure our daughter was eating well. Nancy frequently kept her engaged by taking her out and planning different activities. We are extremely grateful for her and would not hesitate to recommend her to anyone looking for a great childminder!"

From the moment we met her, her sweet and kind demeanour instantly resonated with us, and we knew our daughter would feel the same. Our intuition proved correct, as our daughter has flourished under Nancy's care. Nancy cultivates a warm and welcoming atmosphere that truly feels like a second home for our daughter. The familial environment she provides has been invaluable, and our daughter looks forward to spending time with her. Beyond her nurturing nature, Nancy is incredibly understanding and communicative. She keeps us informed every step of the way and ensures that our daughter's needs are always met with care and attention. Nancy has seamlessly become what feels like an extension of our family, and we couldn't be more grateful for the love and care she shows our daughter. We wholeheartedly recommend Nancy to any family in need of a dedicated and compassionate childminder. She is amazing!"

        "comment": "Nancy has been our childcare provider for the last 7 months. I cannot express what a wonderful person she is. Our child loves being with her, she has a lovely family whom our child is extremely fond of and nothing is ever to much trouble. Nancy takes the time to understand our child and also help them, she will go out of her way to accommodate extra hours and days which gives us the flexibility for our working hours. Nancy collects our child from school and feeds her the days in her care which is of great value with long working days. We have never had a negative response regarding Nancys care from our child, in fact quite the opposite, she is always disappointed if we say she doesn\u2019t need to go on any given day. I cannot speak more highly of Nancys services and if you are looking for a childcare provider, you need look no further."

She is kind,loving and always enthusiastic when my kids have something to tell her and when she has them over. I would highly recommend her to anyone who is looking for a childminder/babysit she is a true gem. XX"

From the very beginning I felt Sam listened to what our needs were as a family and understood exactly what we wanted from our childminder. Sam is professional and friendly to deal with as well as being wonderfully caring, fun and fair with our kids. Her home is always clean and tidy, with plenty of toys and games to play with. Sam always has plenty of ideas and themes of things to do, there\u2019s never a dull day and we\u2019ve never had any grumbles from our children about going! Sam also has a huge back garden for everyone to enjoy which is brilliant during the spring and summer. Her two boys are delightful and my son is now best buddies with her eldest boy. We came across Sam by total chance, at a time when we really needed a trustworthy childminder. She\u2019s never let us down and I\u2019m so thankful and grateful for all she does."

I had \u201cmum guilt\u201d and was very worried about leaving my little boy. After meeting and chatting to Sam, I was completely put at ease. I no longer have any mum guilt and now fully enjoy working while knowing my son is having the best time with Sam and her gorgeous loving boys. I have had more mum guilt during the CoVID situation that he hasn\u2019t been with Sam enjoying all the amazing activities she does with her children! I could never imagine that I would have felt so amazing about my childcare. Sam communicates so well with parents during the day and also at the end of the day in a journal for your child. She has an amazing childcare setting with a enormous garden with lots of activities and an amazing playroom with a great variety of toys for all areas of development. Sam also does a daily activity with all the children in the morning which is at an external children play group and then does an activity at home with the children in the afternoon. I am always so excited to hear what Miles has done. My son was a clingy exclusively breastfed child who for me only really napped on the breast. Sam can get him asleep instantly in a travel cot! I highly recommend Sam and look forward to my son and hopefully future children continuing their early years journey with Sam."

As soon as I met jess I knew my son would be in safe hands. My son had the best time with her and hasn't stopped talking about her since. He cannot wait for her to look after him again. I can't recommend her enough, she's fantastic, a great find."

Veronica is literally God sent and truly has a passion and love for take care of children. My son started with Veronica at 10 months old and is still with her now at the age of 2 year 7 months. He has hit and developed into all his milestone. One thing I really like about Veronica is her attention to detail, she is always up to speed with informing me about my child's development and progression, she makes age appropriate recommendation, she is helpful in teaching and supporting my son. My son loves going to her, he enjoys all the activities and adventures. Veronica always takes him on lots of fun day trip, to the zoo, park, play centres and so much more. I can honestly write many pages on how great Veronica is with my son. She is basically like family to me now and I cannot imagine not keeping her in our lives. I want to use this opportunity to thank you Veronica for all you have done for us, for taking great care of my son. I would always always awlays recommend you. Also it has been comforting to know that you are known by other parents in the area and they have also had great things to say about you."

        "bio": "Hi I'm Rachel, I run Li'l Stompers Childminding in Gravesend Kent. Childminding since 2005 as well as being a parent since 2002. I am an accredited, Ofsted Registered childminder and have all the relevant training required. I can offer spaces from 0y-4y I am off Dering Way at the Lion roundabout near kwikfit. I live with my partner Ben who is a mechanic and runs his own building company and have 2 older children aged 17 studying Engineering at college and 21 who's currently studying at Hartpury Uni doing a Sports education degree. we have several pets; cats, a dog and tropical fish tanks I ensure the children get to go out as much as possible as they love it. I much prefer to be outdoors too. The children have an area just for them which they can use whenever they choose. I have puddle suits to help keep them dry which in turn allows them more time outside in the wetter seasons. The woods and beach are my happy places. My setting is very much child led. I will extend the activity by going by what the child is engrossed in at the time. There are no time limits on activities here. Little minds develop best when they're free. The only times they will need to pause their play is meal times, toileting or nappy changes or if the weather has turned bad. (or they're so covered in dirt, water, goop etc that I need to change their clothes :-) ) I encourage the children to embrace who they are and just 'be'. They will need to come in their old clothes that you don't mind getting paint, glue or dirt on, always need to bring wellies and weather suitable clothing so we can take the opportunity when it arises. We do trips (adventuring) to parks, Leeds Castle, Heritage venues/Zoo's/Shops/Train rides and make the most of the local area. If you wish for a strict more nursery style routine, less outings and more indoor setting then this is not for you. I am very laid back, embrace what life gives us and live very much in the moment. Children are only small once and I believe that the freedom they have as a child in developing themselves as their own person gives them strong life skills to work from once they start school. I have house rules and boundaries in place and encourage the children to just 'be', be free, respectful, kind, embrace themselves and others. At my setting, your child becomes part of our family with many hugs, cuddles, laughs, fun and adventure. PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: I WILL NOT PROVIDE TEMPORARY CARE FOR CHILDREN OFF SCHOOL OR NURSERY BECAUSE THEY'RE OFF SICK. PLEASE STOP ASKING. THEY'RE OFF SICK FOR A REASON AND SHOULD BE KEPT AT HOME. PLEASE THINK OF OTHERS BEFORE ASKING PROFESSIONALS TO INTENTIONALLY ALLOW ILLNESS INTO THEIR SETTINGS. IT GOES AGAINST TTHE EYFS AND OUR HEALTH AND HYGIENE PROTOCALL.",

From our initial interactions, it became clear that Rachel's approach to childcare is both professional and heartfelt. Her commitment to the wellbeing and development of children under her care is evident in every interaction. A few standout qualities we observed: Personalized Care: Rachel took the time to understand Mia's unique needs, ensuring that she provided tailored attention and care. This personal touch made all the difference in Mia's comfort and adjustment. Developmental Focus: Not only did Mia receive excellent day-to-day care, but Rachel also took proactive measures to support her developmental milestones. She was always keen on discussing Mia's progress and suggesting ways to help her further. Communication: Rachel maintained open lines of communication with us. Whether it was a small update about Mia's day or more significant discussions about her developmental concerns, Rachel ensured we were always informed and involved. Proactive Initiatives: Rachel demonstrated forward-thinking by organizing and planning additional support for Mia's needs. Her willingness to seek out and coordinate resources showcased her dedication to Mia's overall wellbeing and development. Genuine Affection: Above all, what stood out was Rachel's genuine affection for Mia. This bond ensured that Mia was not only taken care of physically but also emotionally and mentally. In conclusion, Rachel is a dedicated childcare professional with a genuine passion for children's wellbeing. We, Patryk and Ewelina, are grateful for the positive impact she's had on Mia and would wholeheartedly recommend her services to any parent seeking compassionate and competent childcare. Warm regards, Patryk and Ewelina"

I only had to tell her what our schedule looked like and what the kids eat. She managed everything else. We have tried a few others when our regular nanny is on leave, but no one has managed to make my twins so settled and happy! She was so good that I called her on a weekend so that I could catch up on my office work. I know I will be calling her again :)"

        "bio": "My name is Ashleigh Browne. I am 29 years old and currently live in Greenhithe with my partner and my 5 year old stepdaughter. I am a qualified and experienced primary school teacher. I also have experience as a childminding assistant, nanny, SEN personal assistant and tutor. My experience has predominantly been with children ages 1-7, which links well with my Early Childhood Studies degree where I studied the development of children aged 0-8. I am currently looking for a nanny role for a family with a young child/children, to be looked after in their own home. I am also available for tutoring and babysitting. My previous nanny role was with 3 year old twins who I still babysit occasionally now they have started school. While I was nannying, I would take the children to the library weekly to attend nursery rhyme singing sessions and choose new books to read back at home, to messy play sessions and on walks around the area, including to the park. At home, I would supervise the children's play and meal times as well as providing activities to help the children develop various skills. I encouraged the children to share and play respectfully with each other, taking turns and listening to each others wants and needs. At the end of the day, I would ensure that the children's play room was tidy, while also encouraging the children to help with putting away toys they were finished with. I also assisted in potty training both children (girl and boy). I have experience of tutoring primary school aged children, mainly with a focus on Maths and English. I have a strong understanding of the Maths and English curriculum, including phonics, with experience teaching many different phonics schemes. As well as providing specific tutoring based on the child's individual needs, I am also available for 11+ tutoring. I provide face to face, 1:1 tutoring and am able to provide this at your home or from a tutoring base in Gravesend.",

        "comment": "Ashleigh is superb all-round childcare professional who did a fantastic job of looking after our three-year old twins in our home from March through August 2023. From the very beginning, engagement with my wife and I was extremely professional with all terms and conditions communicated succinctly and formalised in a very straightforward contract. Ashleigh then came to our home for a trial visit to ensure that she was good fit for our children. They took to her immediately and Ashleigh commenced working with them the following week. Everything that Ashleigh does is centred around keeping the children that she is working with fully engaged at all times. Every day that she worked with our twins was filled with reading, activities and learning through play. She put a lot of thought into varying the books that were read to our children, emphasising the meaning through creative use of voices and actions, and pitched her explanations of the nature and purpose of activities at the right level for our children to understand. If either of the children required discipline or correction her stance was firm but non-threatening and she was extremely adept at encouraging our kids to move from one activity to another. From play to reading, from reading to lunch, from lunch to a walk... It was all done quickly, confidently and with minimum fuss. Throughout all of this, Ashleigh constantly emphasised the importance of good natured behaviour and good manners, but in a way that kept both of our children completely enamoured of her at all times. From an administrative point of view, Ashleigh was extremely professional. Her invoices were fully itemised and submitted in a timely manner, her timekeeping was excellent and she kept us provided with updates and photos (via a WhatsApp group that my wife set up for the three of us) throughout every day that she was looking after our children. I would have no hesitation in recommending Ashleigh as a Childminder or Tutor. She takes great pride in her work and strives to deliver excellence in all that she does."

        "comment": "This was our first time as parents having to find a childminder. From our initial telephone call Luliia made us feel at ease and was happy to answer any questions. Lulliia first hand experience as a Mum of 4 and her teaching qualifications were the main reasons for our first contact with Luliia. We were invited to her home to meet her and her family. Our 8 year old has special needs including autism , meaning we were anxious to find the perfect person to care for him. Luliia ticked all our boxes. She is kind knowledgable and has a real connection with children. Her own children were very welcoming and showed love and understanding towards our child. It wasnt long before they were all happily playing together . The one thing that shines through is the LOVE that is in this family. We would highly recommend Luliia. She provides a fun filled time with activities love and care, alongside lovely children to play with Thannk you!"
